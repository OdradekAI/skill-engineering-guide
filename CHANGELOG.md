# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-09

### Changed

- **Terminology standardization** — "Bundles" → "Bundle-plugin" / "bundle-plugin" across all SKILL.md files, README (en/zh), CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, commands, scripts, and references. Establishes "bundle-plugin" as the canonical term.
- **Description length limit** — lowered from 500 to 250 characters across `lint-skills.py`, `audit-checklist.md`, `writing-skill`, and `optimizing`. Claude Code truncates descriptions beyond 250 chars in the skill listing.
- **All skill descriptions** — rewritten to fit within the 250-character limit while preserving triggering accuracy.
- **`marketplace.json` structure** — `description` moved into `metadata` object to match Claude Code marketplace schema.
- **`package.json` keyword** — `skill-engineering` → `bundle-plugin-engineering`; Claude/Cursor plugin keywords `bundles-engineering` → `bundle-plugin-engineering`.
- **`optimizing` skill** — A/B evaluation now dispatches `evaluator` agents (`agents/evaluator.md`) instead of generic subagents.
- **`scaffolding` skill** — validation now dispatches `reviewer` agent (`agents/reviewer.md`) instead of `scaffold-reviewer`.
- **`auditing` skill** — now references `auditor` agent (`agents/auditor.md`) for automated assessment.

### Added

- **`evaluator` agent** (`agents/evaluator.md`) — runs one side of an A/B skill evaluation for optimization comparisons.
- **Optional Frontmatter Fields** section in `writing-skill` — documents Claude Code advanced fields: `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`, `context: fork`, `agent`, `argument-hint`, `model`, `effort`, `paths`, `hooks`, `shell`.
- **Claude Code Hook Events** reference in `adapting-platforms/references/platform-adapters.md` — documents 7 key hook events, hook types, and environment variables (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`).
- **Plugin manifest fields** and **agent restrictions** in platform-adapters reference.
- **`hooks.json` matcher** — added `startup|clear|compact` matcher for `SessionStart` hook.
- **`.gitignore`** — added `.bundles-forge/` pattern for plugin data directory.

### Removed

- **`project-auditor` agent** — replaced by `auditor` (`agents/auditor.md`).
- **`scaffold-reviewer` agent** — replaced by `reviewer` (`agents/reviewer.md`).

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **Minimal/Intelligent dual-mode** in `designing` and `scaffolding` — minimal mode for quick skill packaging (just skills + manifest), intelligent mode for full multi-platform projects with hooks, bootstrap, and version infrastructure.
- **Third-party skill handling** in `designing` — inventory, compatibility analysis, integration intent (repackage vs integrate), and mandatory security audit for imported content.
- **Skill visibility classification** — entry-point skills get matching commands in `commands/`, internal skills are invoked only by other skills in the workflow chain.
- **Advanced components** in `designing` and `scaffolding` — conditional support for `bin/`, `.mcp.json`, `.lsp.json`, `output-styles/`, and `settings.json`.
- **Optional/Advanced components reference** in `scaffolding/references/project-anatomy.md` — documentation for plugin executables, MCP/LSP servers, output styles, settings, userConfig, environment variables, and caching behavior.
- **Commands** for `optimizing` (`optimize-project.md`) and `releasing` (`release-project.md`) entry-point skills.
- **GitHub Release creation** in `releasing` skill — `gh release create` step after tag push, with fallback to GitHub web UI.

### Changed

- **`using-bundles-forge` routing table** — split into "User Entry Points" (designing, auditing, optimizing, releasing) and "Workflow Skills" (scaffolding, writing-skill, adapting-platforms).
- **`scaffolding` description** — rewritten to reflect dual-mode support.
- **`designing` design document template** — now includes mode, visibility column, advanced components, and third-party sources table.

### Removed

- **`commands/scaffold-project.md`** — scaffolding reclassified as workflow skill (invoked by designing, not directly by users).

### Fixed

- **`.gitignore`** — added `__pycache__/` pattern and removed committed `.pyc` files.
- **`.gitignore`** — added missing trailing newline.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-08

### Removed

- **Copilot CLI platform support** — removed from all documentation, hooks, manifests, and SKILL.md files. Copilot CLI has no plugin/extension system; this was fictional. Platform count reduced from 6 to 5.
- **`scanning-security` skill** — merged into `auditing` as Category 9 (Security Scan). Security checklist moved to `auditing/references/security-checklist.md`.
- **`iterating-feedback` skill** — merged into `optimizing` as the Feedback Iteration sub-process.
- **`managing-versions` skill** — merged into `releasing` as the Version Management Infrastructure section.
- **`security-scanner` agent** — functionality absorbed by `project-auditor` agent.
- **`package.json` `main` and `type` fields** — misleading for a multi-platform markdown-based project.
- **`hooks.json` `matcher` field** — unnecessary for `SessionStart` hooks per Claude Code docs.

### Changed

- **Skill consolidation: 11 → 8 skills** — three skills absorbed into their natural parents, reducing cognitive load and improving agent routing accuracy.
- **`auditing` skill** — now includes full 5-target security scanning inline, with termination rule (max one re-audit cycle).
- **`optimizing` skill** — now includes feedback iteration workflow with 3-question validation framework.
- **`releasing` skill** — now includes version management infrastructure (`.version-bump.json`, `bump-version.sh` usage).
- **`hooks/session-start`** — simplified platform detection (removed `COPILOT_CLI` branch).
- **`using-bundles-forge` routing table** — updated to 8 skills with revised descriptions and priority order.
- Updated all cross-references: `bundles-forge:scanning-security` → `bundles-forge:auditing`, `bundles-forge:iterating-feedback` → `bundles-forge:optimizing`, `bundles-forge:managing-versions` → `bundles-forge:releasing`.
- Updated README.md and README.zh.md — lifecycle diagram, skill tables, agent list, command mappings.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` — 5 platforms, 8 skills.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` — expanded from one-line pointer to full quick reference with skill list.
- Updated `project-auditor` agent — now references both quality and security checklists.
- Updated `tests/test-skill-discovery.sh` — expects 8 skills.

### Added

- **"Why Bundles?" section** in both READMEs — concrete explanation of when and why to use the bundles pattern.
- **Python test suite** (`tests/test_scripts.py`) — 12 cross-platform tests covering `lint-skills.py`, `scan-security.py`, `audit-project.py`, and cross-reference integrity.
- **Cycle termination conditions** in `auditing` and `optimizing` to prevent infinite audit-optimize loops.
